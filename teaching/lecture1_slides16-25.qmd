## What is Statistics?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
The practice of collecting and collating numerical facts

- Goes back to beginning of human civilization.
- ... in 1749, word *Statistik* introduced by Gottfried Achenwall.
- From the Latin *statisticum* ("of the state").
- It designated the collection of data about the state.

2) The process of reasoning about the data collected

**Inferential statistics:**

- Parameter estimation
- Hypothesis testing

## Why do we need statistics?

- What is biology about?
- What is economics about?
- What is sociology about?
- ...What is statistics about?

. . .

**Statistics is about variation.**

Statistics helps us make sense of the data and how the data vary.

Statistics is a collection of conceptual and mathematical tools that allow us to study such variation.

## Why is Statistics important for Psychology?

The use of Statistics qualifies Psychology as a science...

. . .

Using statistics we can determine whether a psychological hypothesis is true for a wider population, or whether a treatment works or not.

. . .

Statistical methods provide a unifying force within Psychology.

## What's the origin of Statistics?

Starting from the 17th century, Statistics (the process of reasoning about the data) originated from different fields:

| Field | Contribution |
|-------|-------------|
| Demography | Statistical summaries |
| Astronomy | Theory of errors, normal distribution |
| Gambling | Probability theory |
| Agriculture | Experimental design |

## What's the origin of Statistics?

Let's take a step back...

. . .

In 1687 Newton published *Principia Mathematica*

- Laws of motion, gravitation
- Now it's possible to predict mathematically the movement of objects, including stars!

. . .

But what about other complex phenomena?

## What's the origin of Statistics?

At some point it was found that many events follow what we call a **normal distribution**.

How did they find out?

## What's the origin of Statistics? {.smaller}

Starting from the 17th century, Statistics (the process of reasoning about the data) originated from different fields:

- **Demography** &rarr; statistical summaries
- **Astronomy** &rarr; theory of errors &rarr; normal distribution
- **Gambling** &rarr; probability theory
- **Agriculture** &rarr; experimental design

## Demography

John Graunt, a London haberdasher, born in 1620, tried to predict and explain social phenomena from tables he compiled from the "Bills of Mortality".

## Astronomy

For science to progress, scientists propose hypotheses to test.

. . .

In order to do that, they need to collect data...

. . .

In order to collect data, scientists must make experimental measurements.
