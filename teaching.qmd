I approach teaching through three core principles: respecting students as individuals with unique experiences, engaging them with genuine enthusiasm for the material, and providing opportunities that enhance both critical thinking and career prospects. I see each classroom as a space where mutual respect allows for deep engagement with ideas that help students grow.

## Quantitative Methods in Psychology

An intensive introduction to statistical reasoning in psychological research. This course connects statistical procedures to their historical development and contemporary applications. Students develop proficiency in selecting appropriate analyses, conducting tests in R, and interpreting results meaningfully. Through a partially flipped classroom approach combining interactive lectures with hands-on problem-solving, students build both technical competence and confidence in their analytical skills.

## Cognition Lab

This course bridges theoretical knowledge and practical research skills through active experimentation.  Each week, students explore a new experimental paradigm—examining its theoretical foundations and methodological underpinnings—before building it from the ground up using PsychoPy, collecting their own data, and drafting corresponding report sections. The course culminates in an original research project where students design their own study, collect data from peers, conduct analyses, and produce a complete research report. The course develops both technical proficiency and the research mindset essential for conducting independent psychological investigations.

Students build cognitive experiments from the ground up using PsychoPy, gaining deep understanding of research methodology through direct experience.

## Expository Writing

This freshman seminar approaches writing as a tool for intellectual discovery and academic engagement. Students learn to identify unexpected connections between texts, construct original arguments, and articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision. The course emphasizes revision, peer collaboration, and intellectual risk-taking within a supportive community. Students gain confidence in their ability to contribute meaningfully to academic conversations across disciplines.
