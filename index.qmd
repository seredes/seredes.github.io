:::{#hero-heading}

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at The Ohio State University, working with Ivy Tso. I joined the lab in the Fall of 2023 after earning a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Rutgers University. I am interested in exploring how cognitive constructs like cognitive maps and probabilistic thinking underpin social impairments in psychopathology, particularly in psychosis and autism. I approach these questions using behavioral tasks (sometimes set in virtual reality), eye tracking studies, and computational modeling. By combining phenomenological and cognitive science perspectives, I aim to bridge the gap between experiential and empirical approaches to understanding human psychology. I am also passionate about statistics (and its philosophical underpinnings).
