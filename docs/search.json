    "text": "I approach teaching through three core principles: respecting students as individuals with unique experiences, engaging them with genuine enthusiasm for the material, and providing opportunities that enhance both critical thinking and career prospects. My teaching experience spans large lectures, small labs, statistics courses, and writing workshops across in-person, hybrid, and online formats. I see each classroom as a space where mutual respect allows for deep engagement with ideas that help students grow."

    "text": "Quantitative Methods in Psychology\nAn intensive introduction to statistical reasoning in psychological research. This course connects statistical procedures to their historical development and contemporary applications, making abstract concepts concrete through real-world examples. Students develop proficiency in selecting appropriate analyses, conducting tests in R, and interpreting results meaningfully. Through a partially flipped classroom approach combining interactive lectures with hands-on problem-solving, students build both technical competence and statistical confidence."

    "text": "Cognition Lab\nThis course bridges theoretical knowledge and practical research skills through active experimentation. Students build cognitive experiments from the ground up using PsychoPy, gaining deep understanding of research methodology through direct experience. Each week, students explore a new experimental paradigm—examining its theoretical foundations and methodological underpinnings before implementing it in PsychoPy, collecting their own data, and drafting corresponding report sections. The course culminates in an original research project where students design their own study, collect data from peers, conduct analyses, and produce a complete research report that demonstrates their emergence as independent researchers. The course develops both technical proficiency and the research mindset essential for conducting independent psychological investigations."

Students learn to identify unexpected connections between texts, construct original arguments, and articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision. The course emphasizes revision, peer collaboration, and intellectual risk-taking within a supportive community. Students gain confidence in their ability to contribute meaningfully to academic conversations across disciplines."

I joined the lab in the Fall of 2023 after earning a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Rutgers University. I am interested in exploring how cognitive constructs like cognitive maps and probabilistic thinking underpin social impairments in psychopathology, particularly in psychosis and autism. I approach these questions using behavioral tasks (sometimes set in virtual reality), eye tracking studies, and computational modeling. By combining phenomenological and cognitive science perspectives, I aim to bridge the gap between experiential and empirical approaches to understanding human psychology. I am also passionate about statistics (and its philosophical underpinnings)."
