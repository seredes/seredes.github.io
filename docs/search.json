I joined the lab in the Fall of 2023 after earning a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Rutgers University. I am interested in exploring how cognitive constructs like cognitive maps and probabilistic thinking underpin social impairments in psychopathology, particularly in psychosis and autism. I approach these questions using behavioral tasks (sometimes set in virtual reality), eye tracking studies, and computational modeling. By combining phenomenological and cognitive science perspectives, I aim to bridge the gap between experiential and empirical approaches to understanding human psychology. I am also passionate about statistics (and its philosophical underpinnings)."

Each week, students explore a new experimental paradigm—examining its theoretical foundations and methodological underpinnings—before building it from the ground up using PsychoPy, collecting their own data, and drafting corresponding report sections. The course culminates in an original research project where students design their own study, collect data from peers, conduct analyses, and produce a complete research report. The course develops both technical proficiency and the research mindset essential for conducting independent psychological investigations.\nStudents build cognitive experiments from the ground up using PsychoPy, gaining deep understanding of research methodology through direct experience."

    "text": "Simpson’s Paradox\nDefinition: An association that holds for all of several groups can reverse direction when the data are combined to form a single group. This reversal is called Simpson’s paradox.\nHistory: Simpson’s paradox is named after Edward Simpson: he described this paradox in the 1951 paper “The Interpretation of Interaction in Contingency Tables.”\nPearson and Yule each observed a similar paradox half a century earlier than Simpson, so Simpson’s paradox is sometimes also referred to as the Simpson-Yule effect."
